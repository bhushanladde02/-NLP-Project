Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Key Goals of NLP:

Understanding: Extract meaning from human language
Generation: Produce human-like text responses
Translation: Convert between different languages
Analysis: Extract insights from textual data
Interaction: Enable natural communication with machines
